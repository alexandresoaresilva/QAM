# QAM
16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, implemented at 1000 Hz carrier signal with 125 symbols/s in Verilog.
Mini-project for the Project Lab 3 class at Texas Tech University. Written in Verilog using Xilinx Vivado.

Timinigs of the counters/PWMs are based on a 100 MHz clock (my reference is the Xilinx Basys3 FPGA).
