# QAM
16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, implemented with a 1 KHz PWM signal using the Xilinx Basys3's 100 MHz clock. Four sine wave periods make up a 16-QAM symbol; the first period is always a sine wave zero (base voltage), followed by t3 periods of the amplitude modulated and phase shifted sine wave.
